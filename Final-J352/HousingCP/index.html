<p> In recent years the U.S. has dealt with a housing crisis. Across the country people have struggled to find and stay in quality housing within their price range. College Park is one of the many victims.</p>

<p>According to the Maryland Department of Planning $1,000 to $14,999 a month rent made up only 19% of units from 2014-2018. In 2018-2022 that price range now represents 26% of occupied units in College Park. 

<p>A large population that makes up College Park renters are college students. Students decide to rent off campus for many reasons, for  senior civil engineering major, Micheal Ogunsemowo,  it was finances.
</p>
<p>“I did these [calculations] for both semesters for where I was living, it was equally almost what you pay in an apartment,” Ogunsemowo said. “It was just kinda weird, so I wanted to move off campus because I thought it would definitely save me some money.”
</p>
<p>This is Ogunsemowo’s fourth semester living at the Parkside apartments. He said his rent has increased almost $100 dollars, starting at $750 just before he moved in to now being about $830. Ogunsemowo said his utilities also went up about $50. 
</p>
<p>The Parkside website lists a private room in a two bedroom apartment as $1,350 and a shared room as $850.
</p>
<p>Ogunsemowo said that this rent increase has required him to think more about his finances. He’s had to pick up extra shifts at his jobs to account for the increased expenses.
</p>
<div class="callout">
  <div class="callout-container">
    <em><strong><p>“I’ve had an unforeseen addition of money that I have to pay that I didn’t calculate when I started saving up during the summer,” Ogunsemowo said. 
    </p></strong></em>
  </div>
</div>

<p>He isn’t alone in his concerns. City council student liaison Dhruvak Mirani, and deputy liaison Gannon Sprinkle, have started a University of Maryland tenant union to advocate for student housing concerns.
</p>
<p>Mirani and Sprinkle told the <a href="https://dbknews.com/2024/03/04/umd-tenants-union-student-renters/" target="blank">Diamondback</a> that they heard repeated concerns from students of poor quality and high prices. The Diamondback reported that the union intends to create committees in each off-campus apartment building .
</p>
<p>The union intends to pursue rent stabilization and price caps as well as quickening response times for work orders and addressing health concerns like mold and bugs.
</p>
<p>College Park is rapidly developing and expanding, which is part of the reason it’s becoming less accessible. 
</p>
<p>In September the Campus Village Shoppes, a shopping center housing several multicultural local businesses near campus, announced it would close to be replaced by a student apartment building.
</p>
<p>The Texas-based development company, LV Collective, specializes in luxury, multi-use student buildings.
</p>
<p>The announcement caused many students to voice their support for the shoppes. The <a href="https://dbknews.com/2023/09/29/campus-village-shoppes-townhall/" target="blank">Diamondback</a> reported in September that a labor rights organization on campus, United Students Against Sweatshops Local 54, started an emailing campaign against the building of the apartment building.
</p>
<p>The project is slated to be completed in fall 2027.

<p>An affordable housing complex, Branchville Crossing, will be built at 4810 Branchville Road</p></div>

<p> However, all is not lost in College Park. An affordable housing project was also announced in September. </p>

<p>The Branchville Crossing apartments will serve residents earning 30% or less than the area’s median income, 15 of the 51 units will be open to residents earning 60 % of the median income. according to a release from Multi-Housing News.
</p>
<p>The project is led by Housing Initiative Partnership, a nonprofit organization that works to provide quality affordable housing to the Prince George’s and Montgomery communities. 
</p>
<p>The development will be located at 4810 Branchville road in an Opportunity Zone. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an Opportunity Zone is an economically distressed community certified by the government that may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. 
</p>
<p>The project will also include sustainable building materials. 
</p>
<p>The development company for the project, Cruz Companies, released a statement last year expressing their excitement about the project.
</p>
<p>“We are fully committed to working with local leadership and the community collaboratively to bring this much-needed housing to the city of College Park, Maryland,” Cruz Companies said.</p>
